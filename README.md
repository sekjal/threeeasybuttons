# threeeasybuttons
A simple three button USB keyboard to quickly automate, well, whatever.

## Possible projects
* Service desk interaction statistics (easy, medium, hard)
* 'Call for backup' buttons (more staff, reference librarian, security)
* Patron-facing 'how did we do?' (ðŸ˜ƒ, ðŸ˜ž, ðŸ˜¡)

## How it works
![Diagram of how the pieces fit together](/img/diagram.png)

The device connects via USB to a workstation (any OS will do).  Simulating a human interface device (HID), it sends keystrokes to the workstation, which listens using any of the myriad hotkey solutions out there.  It is the job of the hotkey program to trigger the desired effect when per button.
