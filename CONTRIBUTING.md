# Guidelines for Contribution

This repository uses GitHub pull requests to accept contributions.  Anyone is welcome to contribute additions to this repository that increase the feature set, usability or documentation.

## Bug reporting

Please the GitHub issue tracker to submit and follow up on any bugs, feature requests or questions you may have.  

## Changes to Firmware

Changes to chip firmware should include a testing plan in the commit message; new firmware files are welcome, and will be tested as time and access to particular hardware permits.  Please include accompanying documentation if the firmware requires any additional setup to install or test.  Inline comments are appreciated, especially if you're doing anything funky.

## Scripts for particular HotKey Programs/Data Stores

...are welcome!  Again, testing as time and access permits.  If a script is generic enough to work with multiple programs, please note which in your commit message.

## 3D case designs

At this time, I'm not sure whether it's better to host them here, or link to something like Thingiverse.  If you've got a better design for a container for all the hardware, or one that fits your usecase better, I'd love to see it.
